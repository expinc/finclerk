## Insight

Civillians like me usually use financial cellphone apps to trade financial instruments. Most civillians care about short term market fluctuations. Therefore, most apps are designed to do short term balance analysis, even with some intentional misleading. However, I focus on long term market growth.

There are some professional tools to make investment decisions. But I focus on my earning after the decisions.

It is hard to find an analysis tool available to civillians that meets my requirement. Therefore, I decided to develop my own earning analysis tool.

## Idea

This tool is called **FinClerk**. It helps me record investment activities and analyze investment earnings.
